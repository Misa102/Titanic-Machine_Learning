### 1. Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy led to better safety regulations for ships.

The aim of this project is to analyze the factors that influenced survival rates among passengers aboard the Titanic. Using machine learning techniques, we seek to predict which passengers were more likely to survive based on various features such as age, sex, class, and family size.

### 2. Data Pre-processing <a id="data-pre-processing"></a>

We begin by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset. Data pre-processing steps include handling missing values, converting categorical variables to appropriate data types, and exploring the distribution of features.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a id="eda"></a>

EDA involves visualizing the relationships between different features and survival rates. We explore the distribution of categorical and numerical features, analyze survival rates based on demographics, and identify trends or patterns in the data.

### 4. Feature Engineering & Data Wrangling <a id="feature-engineering-and-data-wrangling"></a>

Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. We extract titles from passenger names, create a family size feature, and handle missing values. Data wrangling involves preparing the dataset for modeling by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

### 5. Model Training <a id="model-training"></a>

We train several machine learning models using the pre-processed data and evaluate their performance using cross-validation. Models include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, random forests, gradient boosting, and others. We compare their accuracy scores and select the best-performing model for further analysis.
